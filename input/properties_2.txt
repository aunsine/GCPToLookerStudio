The house is currently arranged with five bedrooms and reaches over 2,150 sq ft internally. Built between 1816 and 1822, it was recently restored and re-designed with exemplary care by its architect-owner for his family, bringing light and colour to the interiors.\r\rThe updated design repurposes generous Georgian proportions to suit modern life, introducing an impressive open-plan lower-ground floor kitchen and living space which opens fully to the garden through glazed doors.\r\rThe manicured Victorian gardens of Holly Grove Shrubbery run the length of the street, creating a quiet enclave of houses set behind cast-iron railings. This house is located inside the Holly Grove Conservation Area. The smart exterior has a perfectly smooth semi-circular bay window and stuccoed porch that stand out against the bare-brick facade.\r\rEntry is to the raised-ground floor, with a wide L-shaped corridor that leads to two reception rooms. The first of these is currently used as a family room and guest bedroom, with a bed neatly concealed within the cabinetry. Running the width of the house, the second reception room is currently used as a home office, flooded with afternoon sun from a pair of sash windows and door that open to the garden.\r\rThe light-filled living spaces and bedrooms on the upper floors retain their traditional proportions, enlivened with careful architectural interventions. Many good original features remain; beautifully curved archway in the hall, cornicing, concealed shutters and fireplaces. Where original features couldn\u2019t be retained, the redesign allowed for high quality replacements including lovely wide reclaimed floorboards and cast-iron radiators.\r\rMetal stairs lead from a back door to the south-facing garden, bordered by espalier apple trees and bamboo. A new sunken garden room, finished with lime plaster, that sits just below the lawn is a perfect sun-trap. This space leads seamlessly into the kitchen and lower-ground floor living space. One wall of the large open-plan room is lined with minimal cabinetry that rises out of the pale-pink poured-concrete floors, topped with worktops in the same material.\r\rThe striking colour scheme extends to a living space centred around a wood burner, a custom desk space for crafting and a dining room positioned for the afternoon sun. The steels supporting the extension have been left exposed, and a warm brass has been used on fittings throughout. Through a set of sliding doors is a playroom, which could be well-used as a fifth bedroom, and a large en-suite bathroom with concealed utility room.\r\rOn the top floor are three bedrooms and a wonderfully serene family bathroom with a geometric corner bath and tiles that reach up to the vaulted ceiling. In each of the bedrooms the ceilings have been opened up to expose the rafters, and the chimney-breast brickwork left bare. Two of the rooms have been playfully decorated as children\u2019s bedrooms.\r\rHolly Grove is one of the most desirable residential streets in Peckham. The cafes, boutiques and restaurants of Bellenden Village are all within two minutes\u2019 walk. The General Store is a neighbourhood grocery store and coffee shop, presenting the finest seasonal produce including Neal\u2019s Yard cheese and a selection of natural wines. Excellent neighbourhood restaurants include, Levan, Artusi and The Begging Bowl. Review Bookshop is a fantastic local independent bookshop and Brickhouse Bakery is at the station end of Blenheim Grove, for pastries and sourdough loaves.\r\rPeckham is brilliantly positioned for a wide range of amenities including the vast number of delis, restaurants and shops of Lordship Lane, including an Everyman Cinema. The Bussey Building, off Rye Lane, hosts an active and varied programme of yoga\/dance classes and workshops, along with a residency from the Royal Court Theatre.\r\rThe green spaces of Peckham Rye, Telegraph Hill and Goose Green are very convenient for children and dog walkers while Nunhead Cemetery is a beautiful woodland oasis with wonderful views across the city skyline.

Semi-detached, 80ft walled garden, 3-double beds, kitchen\/diner, huge cellar and plentiful original features. Near Peckham Rye station, Bellenden Rd and the high street.\rStep into the hallway and straight into 1840s splendour: this antique Victorian villa was one of ten built for doctors at a local hospital. A huge clematis wraps around the front door, arched panelling hangs from the hall ceiling and a turned wood handrail sweeps up with the staircase. This house has a beautiful entrance, both inside and out. A home that\u2019s been thoroughly loved and holds many happy memories, it has a genuinely lovely \u2018feel.\u2019 It\u2019s unique too: being the only home in the square with a decorated arch between both receptions and the original wrought iron balcony overlooking the garden.Original coving in the hall spills into both receptions, which also have ceiling roses and the French doors at the rear open towards the garden.Fortunately, fireplaces are rife with original examples in most rooms, often with splendidly ornate cast iron grates. The front reception has a solid marble mantel while both receptions have original working shutters. Head downstairs (passing a door to the side return), for a heart-warming kitchen\/diner with finger parquet flooring, cottage-style cabinets, a large fireplace, pretty garden doors and a stove set into a chimney breast. Another notable feature is the original larder. Bonus rooms down here include a fourth room\/walk-in cellar, a large utility room with a loo plus a deep airing cupboard.Ceilings remain high right up to the top of the house, which has a first floor with a rear mezzanine level (much like a second floor). Tradition reigns in the family bathroom which has a freestanding roll-top bath, large sink, cast-iron radiator, plantation shutters and plenty of built-in vanity units. Behind is a bright and roomy master bedroom, while up a few more stairs are two double bedrooms that overlook the exquisite garden below.Measuring a smidge over 80ft deep and an impressive 40ft across, the garden is walled, established, has a York stone patio and a wide, covered side return (the pergola here is a recent addition). Hours of dedication have been put into giving the garden year-round interest. Purple sage, rosemary, chamomile and garlic run amok in the herb garden. Roses, hellebores, camelias and anemones will fill flower vases all summer while other floral eyecatchers include Magnolia stellata, Melianthus, salvia, a fernery, euphorbia, fatsias, salvia, hellebores, honeysuckles and masses of clematis.Walk to Peckham Rye station in under 10 minutes for Zone 2 trains and Overground links (London Bridge, Victoria, Blackfriars, City Thameslink, Farringdon and St Pancras. Clapham Junction, Canada Water, Shoreditch, Hoxton and Dalston Junction). Bellenden Road is brimming with interesting independents: Anderson & Co serves great coffee, FORM SE15 stocks delectable clothes while Artusi, Ganapati, The Begging Bowl, Petitou and Made of Dough are all great places to eat. There\u2019s an award-winning chocolatier on Maxted Road (Melange Chocolate) while cocktails are great at Bar Story, Peckham Springs and Frank\u2019s Campari Bar. Peckham Levels, Copeland Park and Holdrons Arcade are ingenious sites for start-ups, the area is home to many artists\u2019 studios while the high street offers some useful chains (Boots, Clark\u2019s, Argos, Holland & Barrett and Primark). Peckham has several supermarkets, a farmers\u2019 market and a multi-screen cinema.Nearby primary schools include Harris and Belham (both Ofsted \u2018good) while older children can attend Harris (\u2018outstanding\u2019) or Thomas the Apostle (\u2018outstanding\u2019). The Villa is a local private pre-prep while Alleyn\u2019s, Dulwich College and Jags are all a short drive.","Roy Brooks, London","2,\r\nBarry Parade,\r\nBarry Road,\r\nLondon,\r\nSE22 0JA","SE15 5AR",-0.0752418644,51.4718369823,null,"Houses","Semi-Detached","20200224",null,false,"Resale"],[1320000,"4 bedroom town house for sale","Nunhead Green,\r\nLondon,\r\nSE15","http:\/\/www.rightmove.co.uk\/property-for-sale\/property-86244140.html","http:\/\/www.rightmove.co.uk\/developer\/branch\/Site-Sales\/Nunhead-Green-215768.html",4.0,"\n        Reserve your dream home for free today, call today to find out more!\r\rSiteSales are delighted to present Nunhead Green.

Arranged over four floors, the property has high ceilings and large sash windows throughout, retaining generous original proportions while having been lovingly restored by the current owners.\r \rSet behind a neat front garden, a set of steps leads to the raised-ground floor. Entry is to a bright hallway, with a white-painted staircase and floorboards that continue into the adjacent rooms. To the left are a pair of reception rooms with huge windows that look to the trees at either end. There are in-built shutters either side of the tall windows, the ceilings are adorned with cornicing and mirror roses and in each room is a working fireplace.\r \rAt the far end of this room, doors open onto a balcony that leads down to the garden. Planted with figs, eucalyptus and tall trees that are loved by the park\u2019s parakeets, the garden is divided into two spaces; adjacent to the kitchen is a wonderfully private paved courtyard, beyond which is an usually large walled garden that backs onto the park.\r \rOn the lower-ground floor is the kitchen, fitted with white and dusty-pink cabinetry, and a separate dining room. The current owners use the adjacent room as a snug, and there is a separate utility room. Throughout the house the current owners have rethought the original layout of the house, retaining its integrity without contemporary additions, while creating a series of spaces that allow for modern living.\r \rAcross the top two floors of the house are four bedrooms and two bathrooms. One is currently used as a dressing room, with an en-suite bathroom and walk-in wardrobe clad with plywood. The house is oriented east-west and so these elevated rooms are flooded with light throughout the day.\r \rThe gardens along Trafalgar Avenue back directly onto Burgess park, which has recently undergone huge redevelopment. There are tennis courts and football pitches, a new play area, a BMX track and Quietway cycle routes through lovely planting.\r \rThe house lies equidistant between Bermondsey and Peckham which are well-known for their excellent restaurants and pubs, and have good transport links. Buses run towards Elephant and Castle and the City. The Bakerloo Line is within walking distance from Elephant and Castle Underground Station and the Jubilee Line runs from Bermondsey. Still in consultation, the proposed Bakerloo line extension site on the Old Kent Road would be a three-minute walk from the house.","The Modern House, London","St Alphege Hall \r\nKings Bench Street\r\nLondon\r\nSE1 0QX \r\n","SE15 6NR",-0.0745152121,51.4856737012,null,"Houses","Terraced","20191021",null,false,"Resale"],[1165000,"5 bedroom terraced house for sale","Kimberley Avenue, Nunhead, SE15","http:\/\/www.rightmove.co.uk\/property-for-sale\/property-89010110.html","http:\/\/www.rightmove.co.uk\/estate-agents\/agent\/Mundays\/London-143609.html",5.0,"\n        Optimised and immaculately turned-out five bedroom house of some 1608 square feet and over three floors, on a leafy residential Nunhead street (which is off the main high street area) with fancy period-style street lamps and unrestricted parking. The house is no-expense-spared in style and finish. Every detail has been carefully considered and executed, and the result has us very impressed; welcome features include the deVOL fitted kitchen, the independent utility room, the fabulous master suite and the tiled front path.\r\rOriginal charms are in their many, too - for example the Victorian brick facade and bay window to the front reception room, and the south-facing garden: always a winner. Nunhead Station is a 3 minute walk. For Overground trains you can walk 12 minutes to Queen's Road Peckham Station. \r\rA neat and walled front garden sets the house back from the street. Once in the hall, noting the high ceilings, your through-reception sits off to your right. Treated wooden floors lie underfoot, and bespoke built-in storage features in the alcoves (both cupboards and shelving). The lower panes of the sash windows in the bay are frosted for privacy. A wood-burning stove in the front reception area is great for cosy nights in. Travel through here or through the hall (spotting the excellent accessible under stairs storage) to the incredible kitchen\/diner stretching over 23 feet by over 14. With three skylights and double glazed folding doors with a southerly aspect and a garden vista, it's a room you'll find hard to leave. In the left hand corner of the room you access the neat and windowed utility room. Put the washing machine on and shut it away! The garden's a low-maintenance affair with hard and healthy-lawned areas. \r\rUp to the half landing and at the rear of the house is a classic bathroom with traditionally-styled sanitaryware and fittings, over bath shower, built-in storage, and large profile wall tiles. Adjacent is a small single bedroom or home office. \r\rFrom the landing proper, a huge bedroom fronts the house. It's over 15 feet by nearly 11, with two sash windows (with plantation shutters), ceiling-high alcove wardrobes, and stripped and treated floors. A second double bedroom is next door, with sash window and old school style radiator (there are lots of these throughout the house, plus smart vertical rads).\r\rHead up a few more stairs for a third double bedroom that's set to the rear of the house. This one has a double glazed window to garden views. Last but not least is the big master suite. The bedroom area is over 15 feet by over 12 and off this you have a south-facing Juliet balcony, accessible eaves storage, and a classy en suite shower room with large skylight window.\r\rNunhead has a London-village feel with central green, playground and community centre (by AOC architects), and excellent, established staples, including Ayre's bakery and Soper's wet-fish shop. Newish popular arrivals include El Vermut, Babette, and Four Hundred rabbits (posh pizza). The Old Nun's Head is a reliable local. Other strong local pubs include The Telegraph at The Earl of Derby and Skehans. \r\rIt's a short stroll to the Telegraph Hill area's gorgeous parks with views, tennis courts and a weekly Farmers' Market, and also Peckham Rye Park and Common's 113 acres. Locally, Nunhead Cemetery is a beautiful Victorian one (one of 'The Magnificent Seven') with organised tours, and butterflies, birds and beautiful big trees.\r\rFor more options, Peckham, Camberwell, New Cross, Deptford, Brockley and Greenwich are all but a short journey. \r\rLittle ones?

Why opt for a run of the mill terraced house when you can have an interesting, oversized apartment in a period building (plus huge private garden!) within the headlining street of the Holly Grove conservation area? Minutes (five) from Peckham Rye Station and Bellenden Road (two), opposite Holly Grove Shrubbery, you'll find this one-off wonder-pad of 1377 square feet, with three bedrooms and two bathrooms, plus direct access to a generous, richly landscaped south-east facing garden of over 70 feet. Permit-parking is available on-street. Share of Freehold.\r\rHolly Grove is one of the most exclusive streets in the Peckham Rye area, boasting fine Georgian, Victorian and Edwardian architecture. Many of the residential buildings thereon are Grade II listed, and the sunny gardens are particularly coveted - some of the neighbours even open theirs up for public viewing in the summer. Most of the houses on the street face Holly Grove Shrubbery (once known as South Grove), which was opened in 1897.\r\rUp a few steps to raised ground level and you open into a bright, wide, and white-painted communal hall. There is just one apartment above you. It's here that you get your first glimpse of the big private garden, through glazed doors at the rear of the building. The front door is to your right and you land in a spacious hall area, where immediately to your left is a neat guest w.c. Swing a right and you're in a classy and formal reception room of over 15 feet by nearly 12, with two large sash windows, a beautiful marble fire surround, herringbone solid oak floors, and built-in shelving to one wall. To the left of the hall, you open into the roomy kitchen\/reception room of over 16 feet by over 15. This room has such brilliant views onto the garden that it'll be hard to spend time in other parts of the property. The timeless kitchen units are bespoke and display exemplary joinery. Corian counters get a big tick too. A back door to the left hand wall opens to a few steps down to the garden (you can also access the garden from two of the bedrooms downstairs). \r\rThe footprint of the lower ground floor is larger than the living area; as you also have the area under the communal hall. The layout is pretty genius in our view - delivering three large bedrooms, a bathroom and utility room, and an en suite to one of the rear bedrooms. To the front of the building is a large bedroom of 15 feet by over 10. It's softly carpeted, and currently enjoyed as a home office. Off the hall area you open into a neat bathroom with contemporary fittings and white sanitaryware, and both bath and independent shower. It's through this room that you access the utility room. To the rear of the building you've two bedrooms; both with access onto the paved area of the garden. Both rooms have access to large closets, and one has a vivid en-suite bathroom with traditionally-styled white sanitaryware. \r\rWhat a sizzling spot. Currently undergoing further regeneration locally (the Peckham Rye Station refurbishment and Peckham Coal Line projects are particularly exciting), Peckham has loads of independent shops, restaurants, cafes, pop-ups and markets. Within a matter of minutes of the property, you have Artusi, Miss Tapas, The Begging Bowl, Levan, Brick Brewery Taproom, Anderson's, The General Store, Flock & Herd butchery and Review. Rye Lane is at the easterly end of the road for Peckham Levels, The Bussey Building & Copeland Park and Market Building, Frank's, Peckham Plex Cinema, plus handy high street shops, banks and fruit and veg stalls. \r\rCentral Camberwell is a short walk or bus ride for The South London Gallery, The Peckham Pelican, The Camberwell Arms, Silk Road, Nandine and Friday jazz at The Crypt. \r\rGreen space? Warwick Gardens is mere strides away, and Lettsom Gardens is local too. Bigger open spaces include Peckham Rye Park and Common, Ruskin and Dulwich Parks. Little ones? The Villa Nursery and Pre-Prep. School is local, on Lyndhurst Way (2-7 years). The Belham (run by Dulwich Hamlet Educational Trust) is proving a massive hit with local families, and Bellenden Primary is also well-regarded.","Munday's, London","2 Mary Boast Walk, London\r\nSE5 8SP","SE15 5DF",-0.0715878494,51.4697086248,null,"Flats \/ Apartments","Apartment","20200101",null,false,"Resale"],[1000000,"4 bedroom terraced house for sale","Danby Street, London SE15","http:\/\/www.rightmove.co.uk\/property-for-sale\/property-75360409.html","http:\/\/www.rightmove.co.uk\/estate-agents\/agent\/ludlowthompson\/Dulwich---Sales-5483.html",4.0,"\n        A four bedroom Victorian terraced house set on one of the most highly desired residential roads in the heart of Peckham Rye.

Because you only have to put down a deposit on the share you buy, you won't need to save as much for a deposit as you would if you were buying outright.\r\r*Estimated mortgage payments assume an interest rate of 4.50% using a 10% deposit over 25 years on a repayment basis. The actual interest rate can vary. The monthly rent is calculated at 2.75% per annum of the value of the share that is not purchased.

Service charge is only an estimate and may increase in future.\r**CGIs for illustrative purposes only.\r","Notting Hill Genesis","Queen's Road,\r\nPeckham,\r\nLondon,\r\nSE15 2DH","SE15 2DH",-0.0599142063,51.469965649,null,"Flats \/ Apartments","Flat","20200227",1051.0,false,"New Home"],[650000,"3 bedroom flat for sale","Muschamp Road, Peckham Rye","http:\/\/www.rightmove.co.uk\/property-for-sale\/property-92067095.html","http:\/\/www.rightmove.co.uk\/estate-agents\/agent\/Kinleigh-Folkard-and-Hayward---Sales\/East-Dulwich-52719.html",3.0,"\n        Rare opportunity to acquire this truly resplendent Victorian duplex home.

The living space also benefits from having two front facing windows which are almost floor to ceiling allowing natural light to flow generously into the entire space. \r\rIn our experience is rare to find a property that offers such a flexible open plan living space that could function with three areas so comfortably. \r\rA similar experience awaits you in the master bedroom.

NHG owns and manages homes across a range of tenures including social, affordable and private rent and Shared Ownership, of which we are the largest provider in the country.\r\rWhat is Shared Ownership?\rShared Ownership is a part-buy, part-rent government funded scheme designed to help people on getting on the property ladder.\rThe scheme is simple; you usually buy an affordable share of between 25% to 75% of the property's full market value and pay a subsidised rent on the remainder, with an option to purchase further shares later on.\rEligibility criteria apply.\r\r* Estimated mortgage payments assume an interest rate of 4.50% using a 10% deposit over 25 years on a repayment basis. The actual interest rate can vary. The monthly rent is calculated at 2.3% per annum of the value of the share that is not purchased. Service charge is only an estimate and may increase in future.\r**CGIs and images for illustrative purposes only.\r","Notting Hill Genesis","Queen's Road,\r\nPeckham,\r\nLondon,\r\nSE15 2DH","SE15 2DH",-0.0599142063,51.469965649,null,"Flats \/ Apartments","Flat","20200227",1051.0,false,"New Home"],[153000,"2 bedroom flat for sale","Rye Lane, Peckham, London, SE15","http:\/\/www.rightmove.co.uk\/property-for-sale\/property-90041309.html",null,2.0,"\n        ","So Resi, So Resi","London Road,\r\nTwickenham,\r\nTW1 3RP","SE15 4TP",-0.0663591218,51.4673743338,null,"Flats \/ Apartments","Flat","20200302",null,false,"Resale"]]}
